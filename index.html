followed by a rhyming
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>).
<strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Shall I compare thee to a summer'd day? <br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate <br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of may <br>
And summer's lease hath all to short a date.
  </p>
